# Health Data Analytics: Patients, Diseases, and Environment
The dataset covers patient cases from 10 health facilities across five geo-political regions in Nigeria. 
## Goal:
identify regional disease burden, environmental risk, and gaps in vaccination/treatment access.

## Key findings:
##### - Southern regions show higher patient counts and appear more predisposed to disease.
##### - Infectious diseases dominate the reported cases; COVID-19 and asthma are the top two reported conditions, while measles, Ebola and tuberculosis are least reported.
##### - North-East records the most facilities; South-West has the fewest.
##### - South-West shows the highest maximum bacterial counts; North-West the lowest—suggesting regional environmental exposure differences.
## Introduction & Objectives
##### This report summarises and interprets the findings presented in the uploaded PowerPoint, translating them into actionable insights and recommendations for health policy, surveillance and facility planning. Objectives addressed include:
##### 1. Identify regions with highest disease cases and most prevalent diseases.
##### 2. Highlight regions with highest environmental health risks (e.g., bacterial counts).
##### 3. Assess demographic differences in access to vaccination and treatment and identify regions with low vaccination coverage.
## Data Overview & Assumptions
#####- Source: Case data aggregated in the PowerPoint file covering 10 facilities across 5 regions.
##### - Contains: regional patient distributions, number of facilities per region, disease-type frequencies, disease rankings, and maximum bacteria count per region.
##### - Missing/unclear: exact numeric tables, vaccination coverage rates by demographics, detailed age/sex breakdowns, population denominators, and statistical tests.

## Findings
#### Patient distribution by region
##### Southern regions report higher patient counts than Northern ones, interpreted as better access to health facilities in the South.
#### Health facilities per region
##### North-East has the highest number of facilities; South-West has the least. A South region appears missing from the facility list, causing redistribution of patients.
#### Disease prevalence and types
##### Infectious diseases are the most prevalent disease type. Top reported diseases: COVID-19 and Asthma. Lowest reported: Measles, Ebola, Tuberculosis.
#### Environmental health indicator: bacterial counts
##### Max bacteria count per region shows South-West with the highest maximum value and North-West the lowest. This suggests regional differences in environmental exposure.
#### Cost and access observations
##### Slides state cost of health maintenance is high in Northern regions, linked to lower access, but numeric evidence was not provided.
## Recommendations
##### Short Term (0–6 months):
##### - Validate and extract raw data from PowerPoint.
##### - Launch regional awareness campaigns on infectious diseases.
##### - Conduct water and sanitation testing in South-West.

##### Medium Term (6–18 months):
##### - Assess facility access and cost barriers in northern regions.
##### - Study vaccination coverage by age/region.

## Analytics & Monitoring:
##### - Build dashboards to track weekly cases, vaccination, bacterial counts.
##### - Allocate resources to facilities in high-infection areas.
## Conclusion
## The analysis indicates greater patient volumes and higher environmental bacterial maxima in southern regions. Infectious diseases, notably COVID-19 and asthma, are the leading conditions. Facility distribution is uneven, with the North-East having many and the South-West fewer. Policy priorities should include strengthening surveillance, public awareness, environmental testing, and improving facility access in under-served regions.
